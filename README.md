# Oracle-oci-secure-vm-lab
Deployed and secured a Linux VM in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure using SSH keys and network-level access controls
# Oracle OCI Secure VM Lab
## Overview
This lab demonstrates how to deploy and secure a Linux virtual machine in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI) using real-world cloud security practices.
## What I Did
- Provisioned a Linux VM in Oracle Cloud Infrastructure
- Configured SSH key-based authentication (no passwords)
- Restricted SSH access using a /32 CIDR block
- Hardened OCI Security Lists and ingress rules
- Configured route tables and internet gateway access
- Validated access through live SSH testing
## Skills Demonstrated
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
- Linux system administration
- SSH key management
- Network security and access control
- Cloud security best practices
- Troubleshooting and validation
## Why This Matters
This lab mirrors real enterprise cloud security workflows where systems must be accessible to authorized users while remaining protected from unauthorized access.
## Tools & Technologies
- Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (OCI)
- Linux
- SSH
- OCI Security Lists
